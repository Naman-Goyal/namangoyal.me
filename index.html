            Hey! I'm Naman. This is my personal page, where you can learn stuff
            about me. So. I'll start off by saying I'm an aspiring (ENTER PRETTY
            MUCH ANYTHING HERE). Aspiring dev. Aspiring writer. Aspiring animator.
            Aspiring composer. Aspring designer. Bla. Bla. Bla. Honestly the
            list continues to grow. One day I'll end up adding Aspiring rock
            collector or something.

            As far as programming goes, I know java, kotlin and python. I'm also
            learning some basic HTML / CSS. I can fake an understanding of
            react-native by copy-pasting and editing pre-existing code, but I
            don't really know it right know.

            I'm excited to work at DALI because there seems to be a lot of freedom
            in how one has to approach a project. I love the project-based system,
            because I'll be able to stay excited and engaged with whatever I'm
            doing, and I really work best when I'm truly enjoying what I'm doing.
            I also enjoyed getting to know people during my apprenticeship this
            quarter.

            As I mentioned, I like writing a lot. That comes from my insane love for
            reading. Some of my favorite series are:
